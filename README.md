# Modding your FYT uis7862 (ums512) unit without root


### Support via the XDA forum thread ["General FYT based Spreadtrum uis7862 (unisoc ums512) - Q&A, Mods, tips"](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/general-fyt-based-spreadtrum-uis7862-unisoc-ums512-q-a-mods-tips.4396339/)


The zips that can be found in these sub-folders can be directly unzipped to a clean, empty Fat32 formatted USB-stick or SD-card.

When this USB-stick or SD-card is inserted into your unit, the unit will recognize it as a flashable firmware.

Notes:
* These flashable firmware files will leave all your installed apps and settings as they are. Only the files/apks, when relevant, will be overwritten.
* Some scripts and mods are universal FYT mods for sc9853i, uis7862 (ums512) and for sc9863a (uis8581).
